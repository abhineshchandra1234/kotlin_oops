//Inheritance
  //inheritance means accruing some properties of the mother class into the child class.
  //override 
    //It means child class is using function of parent class to do some other task
//Extension
  //In function extension, Kotlin allows to define a method outside of the main class.
//Sealed Class  
  //sealed class restricts the possibility of creating subclasses. And, when you handle all subclasses of a sealed class in an when expression, 
  it's not necessary to use else branch.
//Constructors
  //It is used to give default features to class
  //One Kotlin class can have one primary constructor, and one or more secondary constructor.
  //This secondary constructor is created using the “constructor” keyword. It is required whenever you want to create more than 
  //one constructor in Kotlin or whenever you want to include more
  //logic in the primary constructor and you cannot do that because the primary constructor may be called by some other class.
