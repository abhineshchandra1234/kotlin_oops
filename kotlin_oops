//Inheritance
  //inheritance means accruing some properties of the mother class into the child class.
  //override 
    //It means child class is using function of parent class to do some other task
//Extension
  //In function extension, Kotlin allows to define a method outside of the main class.
//Sealed Class  
  //sealed class restricts the possibility of creating subclasses. And, when you handle all subclasses of a sealed class in an when expression, 
  it's not necessary to use else branch.
